# Titanic_Kaggle_EDA
This repo contains the notebook for the kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster". 
In this notebook i'll use a tecnique called Exploratory Data Analysis, this helped me to understand the data better.

## Index of the notebook:
  * **Import libraries**
  * **Data imports**
  * **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  * **Feature Encoding(One-hot Encoding)**
  * **Model building:** 
    * Logistic Regression
    * Gaussian Naive Bayes
    * Gradient Boosting Trees
    * K-Nearest Neighbors
    * Desicion Trees
    * Linear Support Vector Classifier
    * Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
    * Cat Boost(This is the model on the one we make the predictions with the highest Accuracy)
  * **Model accuracy comparation**
  * **Predictions on the test dataset**
